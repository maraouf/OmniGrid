## What changed in 1.2.0

Second MINOR cut on top of `1.1.0` — rolls up **118 closed issues** under the 1.2.0 milestone. Every entry shipped to the live deploy as a PATCH bump on the daily CI cadence; this MINOR bundles them under a single tag for rollback / changelog purposes.

### Highlights

- **FIDO2 passkeys as a 2FA factor** alongside TOTP — full enrolment flow, recovery codes, force-2FA toggle from Admin → Users, passkey transports rendered as inline chips.
- **OIDC / SSO end-to-end** — Google + Authentik + generic providers; secure cookie cleanup on every callback path; digest-mismatch + RP-ID hardening on macOS WebAuthn.
- **Real-time event stream** replacing the SPA's polling loops — new `/api/events` SSE endpoint backed by an in-process pub/sub bus; toolbar "Live" pill flips state on connection health; `op:created` / `op:updated` / `cache:invalidated` / `stats:refreshed` / `host:row_updated` and ~10 more events wired through.
- **Logs view + daily-rotated retention** — multi-level filter chips, copy-to-clipboard, configurable retention via Admin → Config, on-disk rotation honors level config at runtime.
- **Beszel / Pulse / Webmin / Portainer provider system** — per-provider chips, mono SVG icons, paused-banner state, drawer overlay surface, master enable toggles per provider.
- **Mobile / responsive overhaul** — no more horizontal page scroll on iPhone, mobile-first toolbars, Toolbar + Nodes header wrap cleanly, mobile topbar phase 1.
- **Notifications system** — 12+ event types wired through Apprise, per-event enable toggles in Admin, dedupe window, force-immediate test button.
- **Schedules & automation** maturity — schedule history view, master schedule enable, per-schedule run history.
