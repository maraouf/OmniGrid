## What changed in 1.3.0

Third MINOR cut on top of `1.2.0` — rolls up **316 closed issues** under the 1.3.0 milestone (232 enhancements, 84 bug fixes). Every entry shipped to the live deploy as a PATCH bump on the daily CI cadence; this MINOR bundles them under a single tag for rollback / changelog purposes.

### Highlights

- SNMP infrastructure (per-port throughput chart, utilization heatmap, total-throughput chart, opt-in per-host enable, tunables, uptime + reboot detection, Memory chart unit alignment).
- Ping host-stats provider end-to-end (per-host TCP/ICMP probes, drawer chart, hosts-table cells, cap_add NET_RAW for ICMP, cool-down skip semantics).
- APC UPS over-time charts (Output Load %, Battery %, Battery Temperature) in the host drawer.
- Drawer chart system polish (time-range picker disables-while-loading + spinner; `Updated Xs ago` freshness hint; first-position counters & state debug panel; full unified-cadence #232 timer + pushOnly gate).
- Provider chips + per-provider styling — chip class refactor, reactive colour application, mono SVG icons in provider tabs, paused-banner with debug-panel jump-link.
- Real-time / SSE polish — third "reconnecting" pill state with amber pulse, freshness-watchdog flips connection state on silent half-open sockets.
- Authentication tightening — passkeys WebAuthn QR-only on macOS root cause + fix (RP-ID), digest-mismatch follow-up, three-front fix shipped, OIDC cookie cleanup on every callback path.
- Body-scroll lock when any drawer is open — eliminates accidental background-page scroll while the operator interacts with the host / item / node drawer.
- Snapshot persistence timestamps now reflect the last LIVE probe (not the last save), so the host card's freshness banner agrees with the chart's "Last sample N ago" instead of refreshing on every drawer poll.
- Settings → Host stats refactor (tab strip with horizontal scrolling preserved + vertical scroll locked).
- Hardware card section gate now accepts snapshot-fallback hits so cached host_cpu_model / host_mem_total / host_disk_total / host_serial / host_model / host_firmware / host_vendor / host_swap_used stay rendered when every live provider is offline.
